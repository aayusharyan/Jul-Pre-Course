1. Semantic Tags
- These tags are just like a container, just like a div. But they are for code readability. The code becomes easy to understand. (main, nav, header, footer, section, aside).
- It improves the structure of the code.

- <main></main>
- The main content of the page.

2. Nesting -> One tag inside another.
<main>
    <h2></h2>
    <p></p>
</main>

<main>
<h2></h2>
<p></p>
</main>

3. List - A collection of items.
- <ul></ul> -> Unordered list 
- <ol></ol> -> Ordered List
- <dl></dl> -> Description List

4. Indentation - This is for redability.
<!-- This is indented -->
<main>
    <h2></h2>
    <p></p>
</main>

<!-- This is not indented, not so good readability -->
<main>
<h2></h2>
<p></p>
</main>

5. Image -> This shows image inside the page.
- <img />
- Image needs an attribute called as source (src)
- This attribute tells my HTML where this image is located.
- <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" />

6. Attribute -> Additional options/property passed on to an HTML tag which allows some specific functionality/looks.
- Attributes are ALWAYS added to the opening tags.
- <tag attr=""></tag>

7. Image Alt
- The purpose of this is to give an alternative text.
- For a situation when the image is not loaded, we need to show this alternative text.
- Image is corrupt / the browser cannot support.
- <img alt="This is a photo of something" />

10. Anchor
- <a></a>
- It will help you navigate between pages of your site.
- href (hypertext reference) -> This contains the URL where the user will be taken when clicked on that anchor tag.
- <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com."></a>

12. target attribute
- This allows opening of the link in a new tab.
<a href="..." target="_blank">Click here to go...</a>

13. section tag
- This is also a container, but the use for this is for separating into non-main parts.
- <section></section>

14. List Item
- <li></li>
- This is a single list item of your ul or ol.
- <li>Item Number 1</li>

15. Figure
- <figure></figure>
- This allows to associate an image with a caption.
- A caption is shown WITH the image.
- The difference between a caption and an alt attribute is that the alt is shown when the image is not loaded but on the other hand, the caption is always shown with the image.
- For caption: <figcaption>Text...</figcaption>
- Figure is a container that contains the image as well as figcaption. Whereas figcaption is just for the caption text.

16. Emphasis
- <em></em>
- Used to make a text italic.

17. Strong
- <strong></strong>
- USed to make the text bold.

18. Form
- <form></form>
- This is a container.
- This container contains various input fields.

19. Action attribute
- This attribute tells the browser, where to send the data.
- When the form is submitted, the data needs to be sent somewhere. Where that needs to be sent is by the action attribute.

20. input
- <input />
- This allows the user to enter something on the webpage.
- By default, the type of input is text.
- To customize, we use the type attribute.
- There is a name attribute.
- This gives an identity to the data that we are entering in the form.
- placeholder attribute gives a hint for what to input.
- When I enter something, the hint is gone (because I already know what to enter).
- required -> Makes the input mandatory to fill, without filling this input, we cannot submit the form.

21. button
- <button></button>
- This is an interactive element on which I can click.
- type="submit" -> Allows the user to submit the form.

21. Radio input
- <input type="radio" />
- Allows you to have a choice to select from.
- The way our browser will link them is by using the same name attribute.
- From a radio, we can only choose 1.

22. Label
- <label></label>
- This allows to connect a text to your input, like a caption.
- When I click on the text as well, it will select the radio. (checkbox).

23. Identifier - id attribute
- It is a unique identifier.
- It allows you to check for any specific element of your webpage.
- No two elements can have the same id.
- A single element cannot have 2 ids.
