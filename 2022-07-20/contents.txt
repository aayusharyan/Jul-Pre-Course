1. value attribute
- The name and the value are only sent to the backend server.
- In case of radio (even checkboxes), the name is same.

- This legend element shows the text for that fields.

3. input type checkbox
- This is for when we want to select multiple options.
- This can also have 0 selection.
- We can check and uncheck any option any time.
- Same thing as return (the name attribute has to be same for the browser to connect multiple checkboxes together, even we will use the label element). 

4. label for attribute
- This is helpful when the input is not inside the label element.
- In that case, to link the label and the input, we use for attribute.
- This for attribute of the label will be associated with the id attribute of your input.

5. input radio/checkbox checked attribute
- A checked attribute allows to have default selection for the input type checkbox and radio.

8. Title
- <title></title>
- This contains title of the webpage.
- This title is shown on the tabs.

9. lang attribute
