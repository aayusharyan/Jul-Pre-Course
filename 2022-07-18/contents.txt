1. What to expect?
- This is to get you an idea (like a taste) of what happens in the web dev industry.
- Give a basic intro about the code and concepts.

- VS Code (The code editor used by a lot of developers).

2. What does a Web Developer do?
- Website Design and Development.
- Backend (Logic)
- Database (Storing of Data)
- Solving Real World problems via websites and web applications.

Full Stack:
- Works on pretty much everything related to Web Dev.
- Frontend + Backend + Database + API + Logic + etc etc

- JavaScript + HTML + CSS + Java (DSA)
- Adv -> React, NodeJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS (MERN Stack)

3. What does a Programmer do?
- They write logic.
- A programmer communicates with the machine and make it perform some tasks.(As per the requirement).

4. What is a Programming Language?
- Used to communicate between humans and machines.
- A high level Language is easy for the human to understand. (Java, JS, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc.)
- A low level langauge is easy for the machine to understand. (Assembly).

5. Turing Test (imitation game)

6. Why Java?
- Java is a strict langauge -> You can write more robust code. Less chances of error.
- Java is very popular still. Android core developers use Java. Many enterprises uses Java.
- DSA will be done in Java. Good for Practice.

7. What is DSA?
- Data Structures and Algorithm

8. What is Data?
- A collection of information (A collection of facts)
- Data Type (Type of data that we can store, yes/no, numbers, string).

9. What is Data Structure?
- The organising of data.
- The arrangement of data.

10. What is an algorithm?
- The series of instructions/steps that we give to the machine to execute.
- Logic that we want to execute.
- A set of steps/instructions.

-> Cook maggi
1. Open the packet
2. Put some water in the pan.
3. Turn on the stove.
4. Put maggi
5. Put maggi masaala
6. Wait for 5 mins.
7. Turn off stove.
8. Pour it on a plate.
9. Enjoy


11. What is Internet?
- It's a network (super crazy large scale) connected to various servers and users and devices etc. etc.
- There is standardization involved.
-- https://www.google.com - https is one of the standard protocols that account for security of data.

12. How does most of the internet work?
12. What happens when I open https://www.google.com
- Request and Response Approach

1. User puts in the URL what needs to be opened.
2. Client / Browser / User Agent will make a Request to the server.
3. Server will accept the request and process the request and prepare the response.
4. Server will send back the response to the client.
5. Client will load and display the output.

13. What is HTML?
- Hypertext Markup Language
- HTML is a language used to create structure of a website.
- For looks, we use CSS and for functionality we use JS.


--> Task -> https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/step-1

-> HTML is NOT a programming language because it cannot execute any logic. HTML by it's nature is used to structure the content because of which it is a Markup language and not a programming language.

- HTML consists of tags. Between angular brackets <>
- Coupled -> This has a separate closing -> <p></p>
- Self Closing -> Does not have a separate closing tag -> <input />


14. Paragraph - To show a regular Paragraph text. We use paragraph tag. <p></p>

15. Heading - To show a heading, we use heading tag.
- <h1></h1> - Largest
- <h2></h2>
- <h3></h3>
- <h4></h4>
- <h5></h5>
- <h6></h6> - Smallest

16. Comments - To explain what we have done in a logic to another human. This is for readability. The comments are ignored by the machines.
- Syntax: <!-- Comments.... -->
